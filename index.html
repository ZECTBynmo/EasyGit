        <h3>EasyGit</h3>

<p>The intent of EasyGit is to give non-developers a way to commit assets to a git
repository without having to install and learn git. </p>

<h3>Server</h3>

<p>The server does the actual git stuff. It receives a request to transfer files to a specific directory, then goes through a series of events:</p>

<ol>
<li>Verify that the base directory exists and is longer than 6 characters (you don't want to delete C:/")</li>
<li>Wipe any local changes (git checkout -- .)</li>
<li>Update it's copy of the repository to the remote HEAD (git pull --rebase)</li>
<li>Delete the base directory recursively (this is why it should probably be on a VM)</li>
<li>Copy the incoming files (from the client) into place</li>
<li>Commit changed files within the base directory (git commit ...)</li>
<li>Push the changes to the remote server (git push origin master)</li>
</ol><h3>WARNING!</h3>

<p>GitServer.js performs destructive git operations, including 'git checkout -- .' Make sure that you are running it on a computer that does not have important changes on it. You should probably run it on a VM with a cloned version of your repository, and nothing else.</p>

<h3>Client</h3>

<p>The client side application uses appjs. The user doesn't need to have node.js or git installed on their computer for it to work!</p>

<h3>Client Setup!!!</h3>

<p>A developer must open EasyGit.js and edit the GIT_DIRECTORY_TO_MODIFY constant. It should take the value of the path to the directory that the user will change. For example:</p>

<div class="highlight"><pre><span class="kd">var</span> <span class="nx">GIT_DIRECTORY_TO_MODIFY</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="s2">"D:/Projects/EasyGit/Client/data/assets/img/"</span><span class="p">;</span>
</pre></div>

<p>Then the user of the application would only be able to edit files within /img.</p>

<p>The application connects to the git server automatically. A user has to do the following things to send their changes to the server:</p>

<ol>
<li>Give the path to the equivalent folder on their computer (maybe "C:/MyDocuments/img/")</li>
<li>Type a comment about their changes (to be used as a commit message)</li>
<li>Press submit!</li>
</ol>
