        <h3>EasyGit</h3>

<p>The intent of EasyGit is to give non-developers a way to commit assets to a git
repository without having to install and learn git. </p>

<h3>Server</h3>

<p>The server does the actual git stuff. It receives a request to transfer files to a specific directory, then goes through a series of events:</p>

<p>1) Verify that the base directory exists and is longer than 6 characters (you don't want to delete C:/")
2) Wipe any local changes (git checkout -- .)
3) Update it's copy of the repository to the remote HEAD (git pull --rebase)
4) Delete the base directory recursively (this is why it should probably be on a VM)
5) Copy the incoming files (from the client) into place
6) Commit changed files within the base directory (git commit ...)
7) Push the changes to the remote server (git push origin master)</p>

<h3>WARNING!</h3>

<p>GitServer.js performs destructive git operations, including 'git checkout -- .' Make sure that you are running it on a computer that does not have important changes on it. You should probably run it on a VM with a cloned version of your repository, and nothing else.</p>

<h3>Client</h3>

<p>The client side application uses appjs. The user doesn't need to have node.js or git installed on their computer for it to work!</p>

<h3>Client Setup!!!</h3>

<p>A developer must open EasyGit.js and edit the GIT_DIRECTORY_TO_MODIFY constant. It should take the value of the path to the directory that the user will change. For example:</p>

<p>var GIT_DIRECTORY_TO_MODIFY = "D:/Projects/EasyGit/Client/data/assets/img/";</p>

<p>Then the user of the application would only be able to edit files within /img.</p>

<p>The application connects to the git server automatically. A user has to do the following things to send their changes to the server:</p>

<p>1) Give the path to the equivalent folder on their computer (maybe "C:/MyDocuments/img/")
2) Type a comment about their changes (to be used as a commit message)
3) Press submit!</p>
