{"name":"Easygit","body":"### EasyGit\r\nThe intent of EasyGit is to give non-developers a way to commit assets to a git\r\nrepository without having to install and learn git. \r\n\r\n### Server\r\nThe server does the actual git stuff. It receives a request to transfer files to a specific directory, then goes through a series of events:\r\n\r\n1. Verify that the base directory exists and is longer than 6 characters (you don't want to delete C:/\")\r\n2. Wipe any local changes (git checkout -- .)\r\n3. Update it's copy of the repository to the remote HEAD (git pull --rebase)\r\n4. Delete the base directory recursively (this is why it should probably be on a VM)\r\n5. Copy the incoming files (from the client) into place\r\n6. Commit changed files within the base directory (git commit ...)\r\n7. Push the changes to the remote server (git push origin master)\r\n\r\n\r\n### WARNING!\r\nGitServer.js performs destructive git operations, including 'git checkout -- .' Make sure that you are running it on a computer that does not have important changes on it. You should probably run it on a VM with a cloned version of your repository, and nothing else.\r\n\r\n### Client\r\nThe client side application uses appjs. The user doesn't need to have node.js or git installed on their computer for it to work!\r\n\r\n### Client Setup!!!\r\nA developer must open EasyGit.js and edit the GIT_DIRECTORY_TO_MODIFY constant. It should take the value of the path to the directory that the user will change. For example:\r\n\r\n```javascript\r\nvar GIT_DIRECTORY_TO_MODIFY = \"D:/Projects/EasyGit/Client/data/assets/img/\";\r\n```\r\n\r\nThen the user of the application would only be able to edit files within /img.\r\n\r\nThe application connects to the git server automatically. A user has to do the following things to send their changes to the server:\r\n\r\n1. Give the path to the equivalent folder on their computer (maybe \"C:/MyDocuments/img/\")\r\n2. Type a comment about their changes (to be used as a commit message)\r\n3. Press submit!","note":"Don't delete this file!
