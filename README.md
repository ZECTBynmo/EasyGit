# EasyGit

This is a simple git interface so that non-programmers can change files in git repostiories without having a copy of the entire codebase and without having to learn git.

### WARNING! 

Basically, you probably shouldn't use this yet. If you want to help me test it, great, but otherwise stay away. There are almost definitely land mines. This software does destructive git operations and deletes batch files. I haven't tested it enough to convince myself it's safe for others.

I take no responsibility for work you lose while using this product! Help me test it in the real world, and we can make sure that doesn't happen.

If you're still not scared, some advice: Setup a VM with a clean repository and setup the server there. That way you have no chance of the server blowing away your development repository state while you're doing work :)
